In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when working with nested routes and route parameters.  If you have a parent route with a parameter and a child route that also uses parameters, the child route might not correctly access its own parameters if you aren't careful with how you define your routes.  For example:

```javascript
<Route path='/parent/:parentId' element={<Parent />}>
  <Route path=':childId' element={<Child />}/>
</Route>
```

In this setup, the `Child` component might incorrectly try to access `parentId` instead of `childId`, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. This happens because the child route's parameter path `:childId` is relative to the parent route, and the router interprets the path as `/parent/:parentId/:childId`.

This can cause issues if `parentId` and `childId` values are not compatible.

The error might not be a direct error message but rather incorrect data rendering or unexpected route behavior.
